Steps to use ScrollBox:  

Drag a ScrollBox on the form  

Drag another ScrollBoxContent to the ScrollBox  

Adjust the height of ScrollBox and ScrollBoxContent  

Recommendation: The level of sub-controls on the ScrollBox should be as small as possible.  

At runtime, scrolling is only possible when the height of the ScrollBoxContent is greater than the height of the ScrollBox.
